        <h2>A tasty lasagna for any occassion (FROM REDDIT)</h2>
        <p> When I was in the Caribbean on vacation when I was about 12 years old, my parents took me to this famous Italian restaurant where they served the best lasagna imaginable. I have been chasing that lasagna for almost 15 years. I live in NY too and been to Italy several times so I’ve been to all the great Italian restaurants - nothing holds a candle to that lasagna. I’ve also tried so many lasagna recipes and I’ve never been able to find the lasagna that comes close to that one I tried so many years ago - until today.</p>
        <p>Ok so this lasagna is really a 2-day recipe at best but if you don’t have time you can probably shorten it to one day. This recipe is modified based on a few different lasagna recipes and tips and tricks I’ve learned on the way through my lasagna quest. Obviously lasagna is amazing for meal prep because it makes so much. Also you can prepare the whole lasagna and then freeze it and bake it later.   </p>
            
        <p>Cooking time: approx 2 days for best results, 1 hour active cooking time; 12 servings, about $2-$3 each</p>

            <li>1/2 cup additional Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>2 tbsp chopped fresh basil, additional</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>INSTRUCTIONS</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Meat sauce: PREPARE DAY AHEAD AND LEAVE UP TO 24 HOURS IN FRIDGE - if you are not able to do this just leave it in the fridge as long as possible. Leaving in the fridge will enhance flavors and allow the meat to absorb the sauce more, resulting in a more flavorful and less mushy lasagna.
            </li>
            <li>To cook the meat sauce, heat a large Dutch oven over medium heat, add in olive oil. Cook the onions, carrots and mushroom 5 minutes. Add in the chopped garlic and cook for an additional 1-2 mins or until fragrant. Add in in the ground beef and sausage and cook until browned. Add in the red wine on high heat and cook off most of the wine, approx 2-3 mins. Add in the tomato paste, tomato sauce, crushed tomatoes, sugar, and all seasonings including fresh basil & parsley. Bring to a boil then simmer on low heat with lid covering for 1.5 hours stirring occasionally. Taste for seasonings and adjust as necessary. Allow to cool completely then store in fridge covered until it’s needed for assembly.</li>
            <li>Cheese filling: prepare this the next day. Combine all cheese filling ingredients in a bowl, mix well with a whisk.
            </li>
            <li>After the meat sauce has been resting for up to 24 hours, assemble the lasagna about 2-3 hours (or up to an additional 24 hours) before you plan to bake it. This allows the noodles to absorb a bit of the sauce and results in a more homogenized and less mushy lasagna.
            </li>
            <li>Prepare the lasagna noodles: do not boil these noodles! Get a big bowl, put the noodles in and soak them in super hot tap water for 20-30 minutes. Boiling them instead will result in an overcooked noodle in the end and a mushy lasagna!
            </li>
            <li>Assembly instructions: in a 10x13 deep casserole dish or 2, 8x8 deep pans, place 1/3 of meat sauce down. Layer with lasagna noodles. Then layer with 1/3 cheese filling, 1/3 meat sauce, and 1/4 of the grated fresh mozzarella, and sprinkle Parmesan cheese on top and a little bit of basil; cover with another layer of noodles and repeat this layering method. For the last layer, put remaining 1/3 cheese filling, sprinkle fresh basil, cover with remaining fresh mozzarella, and put a generous sprinkling of Parmesan cheese. Cover and place in fridge until ready to bake. Or if you want to freeze for later, cover tightly with a layer of aluminum foil then several layers of plastic wrap and store in freezer for up to 2 months (when ready to bake defrost night before in fridge and then follow baking instructions below).
            </li>
            <li>To bake: preheat oven to 375 degrees. Remove lasagna from fridge and leave on countertop for about 30 mins. Cover lasagna with aluminum foil being careful it doesn’t touch the cheese on top. Bake for 25 mins covered and then 30 mins uncovered. Then turn on the broiler on high for about 2-3 mins, monitoring closely to ensure it doesn’t burn but broil until cheese is nicely browned. Allow to cool for 20 mins before slicing and serving.
